                <h2>My first project</h1>
                <p>Laura is one of the kindest and most beautiful people I’ve ever met. We’ve been friends for 17 years, and even though we’ve lived in different countries and gone through long periods without talking, every time we reconnect, it feels like we were never apart.</p>

                <p>She’s the only person who can tell me off, and I take it because I know she truly cares about me. Even though she’s two years younger, I call her my "Mommy" because she looks after me like a mother would.</p>
                    
                <p>I’m so lucky to have her in my life—not just as a friend, but like a sister and my Canadian "Mom." I always dreamed of having a friend who truly cares, and I found that in her. Her whole family—her husband Mino, and their amazing kids Baris, Ozzy, and Demir—are such a gift, and I love them all.</p>
                    
                <p>They’ve helped me so much. When I had nowhere to stay, I was always welcome in their home, and Laura made sure I had food. I feel so blessed to have them in my life.</p>
